# class-vmts
These VMTs are specific to trying to get them to work under **sv_pure 1** limitations. They have been modified to use a different directory than the one they have by default. This repo is also intended to be used when following this wiki page for SOUP: https://github.com/Sloofy/soup/wiki/sv_pure-1-and-You!
